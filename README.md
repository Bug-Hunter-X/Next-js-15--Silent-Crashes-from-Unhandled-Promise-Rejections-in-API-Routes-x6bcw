# Next.js 15: Silent Crashes from Unhandled Promise Rejections in API Routes

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 applications where unhandled promise rejections within API routes can lead to silent crashes.  The application appears to function normally, but the underlying error prevents proper operation.

## Problem

The `about.js` page makes a fetch request to `/api/data`. The `/api/data` route attempts to fetch external data, but doesn't explicitly handle potential errors from the external API.  If the external API is unreachable or returns an error, the promise rejects silently, causing unexpected behavior or crashes in the Next.js application.

## Solution

Proper error handling is crucial.  The solution involves using `.catch()` to handle any rejected promises within the API route, preventing the unhandled rejection and resulting crash.   This allows the application to gracefully handle failures and provide informative error messages if needed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that the page loads initially, but the application may silently fail, depending on the external API's availability.
6. Examine the browser console to look for potential errors.
